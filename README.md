# Project Overview
Analysing adult income data shows how parameters like races, genders, and educations can affect the amount of income.
**Income yield prediction** salary income is largly influenced by age, gender, and race. Reliable information about the income level for those categories is critical for making prediction of their income.

## Why this topic?
***"How does inequality affect the individual, society and the economy?"*** ([The Equality Trust, 2023](https://equalitytrust.org.uk/about-inequality/impacts#:~:text=Less%20equal%20societies%20have%20less,financial%20crisis%2C%20debt%20and%20inflation.))

Less equivalent social orders have less steady economies. Elevated degrees of pay disparity are connected to monetary insecurity, monetary emergency, obligation and expansion.

***"We need bold actions!"***  

The inequality impacts economic, social mobility and education, crime, health, trust, participation, atitude, and happiness. ([The Equality Trust, 2023]([https://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/](https://equalitytrust.org.uk/about-inequality/impacts#:~:text=Less%20equal%20societies%20have%20less,financial%20crisis%2C%20debt%20and%20inflation.)https://equalitytrust.org.uk/about-inequality/impacts#:~:text=Less%20equal%20societies%20have%20less,financial%20crisis%2C%20debt%20and%20inflation.))
